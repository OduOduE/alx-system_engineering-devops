RegExp (short for Regular Expression) is a powerful tool used to match patterns in strings. It's a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern and it's often used in programming languages, text editors, and command-line tools for searching and manipulating text.

In this project, I will be learning to use RegExp!!! /grin/
