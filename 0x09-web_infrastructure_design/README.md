DevOps      SysAdmin        web infrastructure

In this project, I whiteboarded the working of different configurations of web
infrastuctures.
I went ahead to to describe each configuration in an accompanying .txt file.

The 0th task is made up of a simple infrastructure, with one server, and not
properly secured or scalable.

The 1st has added servers and a load balancer to go along, for scalability and
load sharing.

The 2nd has firewalls, SSL certificate and monitoring components added for
security and authentication.

The 3rd has an extra load-balancer to prevent SPOF, and the web, application and database
servers split into separate components for optimal functionality.
