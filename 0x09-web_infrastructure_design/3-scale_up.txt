Adding one server allows dor better fault tolerance and scalability. With three
servers, the load can be better distributed to increase redundancy.

The extra load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as a cluster with the other one
provides high availability and fault tolerance: if one HAproxy is down, the
other one takes over, thus the website stays online; cancelling the supposed
Single point of failure (SPOF).

Splitting the components (web servers, application server, and database) with
their own servers allows optimal use of each. DB server can be optinized for
better storage and retrieval of data, application server for running code more
efficiently, and web servers for running web pages faster.

Overall, this configuration improves scalability, fault tolerance, and
component optimization.
