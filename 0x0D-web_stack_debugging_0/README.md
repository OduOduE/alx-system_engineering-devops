Background Context
The Webstack debugging series is a training in the art of debugging. Computers
and software don't always work the way we want (thats the fun part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given, the final goal
is for me to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the
webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, I should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.
